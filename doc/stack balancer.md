#Retro Stack Balancer

In search of minimum viable Fabri, I propose to start with stack-balancing Retro.

Retro is in a transition from 11 to 12 but this is unlikely to affect the core vocabulary or its effects.

The little insight is that the stack effect of a word can be printed as a sparkline. I just think that would be pretty.
